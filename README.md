## Introduction

Dive into iXRLibForWebXR, where integrating XR analytics into your web applications becomes a breeze. From real-time event tracking to AI model interactions, this library enhances the capabilities of web-based XR platforms, ensuring a rich and interactive user experience.

## Installation

Get started with iXRLibForWebXR by installing the package via npm:

```bash
npm install ixrlibforwebxr
```

## Quick Start

Jump right into using iXRLibForWebXR with this simple setup:

```typescript
import { iXRInit } from 'ixrlibforwebxr';

async function main() {
  const authData = {
    appId: 'your-app-id',
    orgId: 'your-org-id',
    deviceId: 'web-xr',
    authSecret: 'your-auth-secret'
  };

  const iXR = await iXRInit(authData);

  // Track a user action
  await iXR.Event('user_action', 'action=click,target=button');

  // Log user progress
  await iXR.LogInfo('User completed onboarding');

  // Send performance metrics
  await iXR.Telemetry('performance_metrics', { fps: 60, latency: 20 });
}

main();
```

## Features

### Event Tracking
Capture user interactions and system events with ease. Hereâ€™s how you can track a button click:

```typescript
await iXR.Event('button_click', 'action=submit,page=checkout');
```

### Logging
Keep tabs on what happens in your application by logging information, warnings, and errors:

```typescript
await iXR.LogInfo('User logged in successfully');
await iXR.LogWarning('Low storage space detected');
await iXR.LogError('Failed to process payment');
```

### Telemetry
Gather and send performance metrics to analyze and optimize application performance:

```typescript
await iXR.Telemetry('performance_metrics', { fps: 60, memory_usage: 512 });
```

### AI/LLM Integration
Interact with AI language models to enhance user interaction and system intelligence:

```typescript
const response = await iXR.AIProxy('Translate "Hello" to French', 'gpt-3.5-turbo');
```

### Data Storage
Effortlessly store and retrieve data on the fly, supporting complex data management needs:

```typescript
await iXR.StoreData('user_progress', { level: 5, score: 1000 }, 'keepLatest');
const data = await iXR.GetData({ name: 'user_progress' });
```

## API Reference

For a detailed list of all available methods and their parameters, please refer to the API section in the documentation.

## Authentication

Securely manage user sessions by providing necessary authentication data when creating an iXR instance. You can also pass authentication data via URL parameters:

```url
https://yourdomain.com?appId=your-app-id&orgId=your-org-id&deviceId=web-xr&authSecret=your-auth-secret
```

## Best Practices

- **Early Initialization**: Initialize the iXR instance as early as possible in your application lifecycle.
- **Meaningful Metadata**: Use meaningful event names and metadata for better analytics and insights.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Ensure to handle errors gracefully, especially for network-dependent operations.
